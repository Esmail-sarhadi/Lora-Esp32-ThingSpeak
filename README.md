# 🌐 LoRa Communication Project

This project involves a LoRa communication setup where multiple sensor nodes transmit temperature and humidity data to a central server. The server processes this data and optionally sends it to the internet.

## 📖 Introduction

The project includes:
- **📡 Sensor Nodes**: Collect temperature and humidity data.
- **🖥️ Central Server**: Receives data from nodes, processes it, and optionally uploads it to the internet.

### 🌟 Node Types
1. **Node 1**: Transmits data with Node ID "11".
2. **Node 2**: Transmits data with Node ID "12".

### 🖥️ Server
- Receives data from nodes and sends it to ThingSpeak via the internet.

## 🔧 Components

- **📡 LoRa Module** (e.g., RFM95)
- **🌡️ DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
- **🔌 Arduino** (or compatible microcontroller)
- **🔗 Jumper wires**
- **🔲 Breadboard**

## 🔌 Wiring

### 🟢 Node Wiring
- **🌡️ DHT11 Sensor**:
  - VCC to 5V
  - GND to GND
  - Data to Pin 4
- **📡 LoRa Module**:
  - VCC to 3.3V
  - GND to GND
  - CS to Pin 26
  - RST to Pin 12
  - INT to Pin 25

### 🔵 Server Wiring
- **📡 LoRa Module** (same as nodes):
  - VCC to 3.3V
  - GND to GND
  - CS to Pin 26
  - RST to Pin 12
  - INT to Pin 25

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Install Libraries**:
   - `📦 RH_RF95`
   - `📦 SPI`
   - `📦 DHT`
 
2. **Upload the Code**:
   - For **Node 1**: Ensure `numNode1` and `numNode2` are set to '1'.
   - For **Node 2**: Ensure `numNode1` is '1' and `numNode2` is '2'.
   - For the **Server**: Configure with your ThingSpeak API key and make sure it’s set to receive and process data.

3. **Power the Devices**:
   - Ensure all components are connected properly and power them up.
